Work-in-progress quadruped robot

January 2nd, 2024:
Since I could remember, I have always wanted my dog to have another dog to play with. I realized that if I could not force my parents to buy one, why couldn't I just make one? This repo serves as not just my files for my robot, but also as a log as I continue to work on this robot. As of today, I have built a working leg prototype, yet the code is not there yet...
